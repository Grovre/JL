[15:40:35] [Server thread/WARN]: [CrazyCrates] CrazyCrate Update: 1.17 is one of 4 major updates.
[15:40:35] [Server thread/WARN]: [CrazyCrates] Please submit any bugs at https://github.com/Crazy-Crew/CrazyCrates/issues
[15:40:35] [Server thread/WARN]: [CrazyCrates]
[15:40:35] [Server thread/WARN]: [CrazyCrates] I will wait between releasing updates for bug reports
[15:40:35] [Server thread/WARN]: [CrazyCrates] The next version is Version 2.0 excluding version bumps for Minecraft releases or some easy features/enhancements
[15:40:35] [Server thread/WARN]: [CrazyCrates]
[15:40:35] [Server thread/WARN]: [CrazyCrates] 2.0 is a hard break, Legacy color codes will no longer work, Configurations will be fully migrated, Placeholders will change and so on.
[15:40:35] [Server thread/WARN]: [CrazyCrates] We only support https://papermc.io in 2.0 and will fully migrate to Modrinth and Hangar.
[15:40:35] [Server thread/WARN]: [CrazyCrates] After that's done, I'll be adding practically anything including light gui editors or in-game editors ( improved /cc additem ) and crate conversions.
